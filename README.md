# Color Flipper

I decided to start this project when I was looking through [this list of
projects.][projects] I was just a little bit bored and I wanted to do some
programming. Recently, I had also been thinking about the process of finding the
inverse of a color, and I suspected that it was as simple as flipping each bit
of the hex code, and it turns out that's pretty spot-on.

The app is made with Macroquad, a Rust library for simple 2D graphics.
